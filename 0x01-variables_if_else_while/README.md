* Operating System: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* Allowed Editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
* All the C files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
* The use of `system` is not allowed.
* Code Style: <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty">Betty Style</a>

### Learning Objectives

* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them.
* What the the relational operators and how to use them.
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C.
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them.
* How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements.
* How to use comments.
* How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`.
* How to assign values to variables.
* How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`.
* How to use the `while` loop.
* How to use variables with the `while` loop.
* How to print variables using `printf`.
* What is the `ASCII` character set.
* What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`.


### Script Information
0. **0-positive_or_negative.c** - Completes the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative. Find the source code <a href="https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw">here</a>. The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program. The output of the program should be:
    * The number, followed by:
        * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
        * if the number is 0: `is zero`
        * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * followed by a new line.<br>
1. **1-last_digit.c** - Completes the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`. You can find the source code <a href="https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/5HWhPDsq3jq1yCRQFrLl4Q">here</a>. The output of the program should be: 
    * The string `Last digit of`, followed by
    * `n`, followed by
    * the string `is`, followed by
        * if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
        * if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
        * if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
    * followed by a new line<br>
2. **2-print_alphabet.c** -  Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. 
    * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden). 
    * All your code should be in the `main` function. 
    * You can only use `putchar` twice in your code.<br>
3. **3-print_alphabets.c** - Prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use `putchar` three times in your code.<br>
4. **4-print_alphabt.c** - Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    * Print all the letters except `q` and `e`.
    * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden). All your code should be in the `main` function. 
    * You can only use `putchar` twice in your code.<br>
5. **5-print_numbers.c** - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.<br>
6. **6-print_numberz.c** - Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.
    * You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
    * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden).
    * You can only use `putchar` twice in your code.<br>
7. **7-print_tebahpla.c** - Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
    * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden).
    * You can only use `putchar` twice in your code.<br>
8. **8-print_base16.c** - Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden).
    * You can only use `putchar` three times in your code.<br>
9. **9-print_comb.c** - Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
    * Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
    * Numbers should be printed in ascending order
    * You can only use `putchar` four times maximum in your code.
    * You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
    * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden).<br>
