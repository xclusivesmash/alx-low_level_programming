# C - Preprocessor

### Description
This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing programming skills at ALX SE Programme. This repository has C files created for a deeper understanding of the preprocessor in C.

### Requirements
* Language(s): `C`
* Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
* Style Guide: <a href="https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/wQ4sMfsWfxvyfN67Sc11zA">Betty Style</a>
* Compilation should be achieved using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`, and 'exit'. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The use of global variables is not allowed.
* The use of <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c">_putchar</a> is allowed.
* The prototypes of all the functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` are included in the header file called `main.h`

### Learning Objectives
* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

### Script information
0. **0-object_like_macro.h** - a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
<br>

1. **1-pi.h** - a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
<br>

2. **2-main.c** - prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
    * The use of the standard library is allowed.
<br>

3. **3-function_like_macro.h** - a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
<br>

4. **4-sum.h** - function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
