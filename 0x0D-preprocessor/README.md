# C - Preprocessor

### Description
This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing problem solving skills through programming and other technologies. This repository contains `.c` files created for a deeper understanding of the `C` preprocessor and macros.

### Learning Objectives
* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

### Requirements
* Language(s): `C`
* Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* Style Guide: <a href="https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/tree/master">Betty Style</a>
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
* Compilation should be achieved using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The use of global variables is not allowed.
* You are allowed to use <a href="https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c">_putchar</a>

### Scripts

0. **0-object_like_macro.h** - creates a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
<br>

1. **1-pi.h** - creates a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
<br>

2. **2-main.c** - prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line. The use of standard library is allowed.
<br>

3. **3-function_like_macro.h** - a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
<br>

4. **4-sum.h** - a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
