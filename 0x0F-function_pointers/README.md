# C - Function pointers

### Description
This repository contains scripts that are created as part of the learning objectives of programming at ALX SE programme. The emphasis is on enforcing problem solving skills through programming and other technologies. This repository contains `.c` files created for a deeper understanding of function pointers in C.

### Learning Objectives
* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

### Requirements
* Language(s): `C`
* Operating system: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
* Style Guide: <a href="https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/tree/master">Betty Style</a>
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
* Compilation should be achieved using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The use of global variables is not allowed.
* You are allowed to use <a href="https://github.com/alx-tools/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c">_putchar</a>
* All header files should be include guarded.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h`

### Scripts

0. **0-print_name.c** - a function that prints a name.
    * Prototype: ``void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));`
<br>

1. **1-array_iterator.c** - a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
    * Prototype: `void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));`
    * where `size` is the size of the array
    * and `action` is a pointer to the function you need to use
<br>

2. **2-int_index.c** - a function that searches for an integer.
    * Prototype: `int int_index(int *array, int size, int (*cmp)(int));`
    * where `size` is the number of elements in the array `array`
    * `cmp` is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
    * `int_index` returns the index of the first element for which the `cmp` function does not return `0`
    * If no element matches, return `-1`
    * If size <= `0`, return `-1`
<br>

3. The program that performs simple operations.
    * You are allowed to use the standard library
    * Usage: `calc` `num1` `operator` `num2`
    * You can assume `num1` and `num2` are integers, so use the atoi function to convert them from the string input to `int`
    * `operator` is one of the following:
        * `+`: addition
        * `-`: subtraction
        * `*`: multiplication
        * `/`: division
        * `%`: modulo
    * The program prints the result of the operation, followed by a new line
    * You can assume that the result of all operations can be stored in an `int`
    * if the number of arguments is wrong, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `98`
    * if the operator is none of the above, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `99`
    * if the user tries to divide (`/` or `%`) by `0`, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `100`

    * **3-main.c**- This file should contain your `main` function only.
    * You are not allowed to code any other function than `main` in this file
    * You are not allowed to directly call `op_add`, `op_sub`, `op_mul`, `op_div` or `op_mod` from the `main` function
    * You have to use `atoi` to convert arguments to `int`
    * You are not allowed to use any kind of loop
    * You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 `if` statements
 
    * **3-calc.h** - This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.
    * **3-op_functions.c** - This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):
        * `op_add`: returns the sum of `a` and `b`. Prototype: `int op_add(int a, int b);`
        * `op_sub`: returns the difference of `a` and `b`. Prototype: `int op_sub(int a, int b);`
        * `op_mul`: returns the product of `a` and `b`. Prototype: `int op_mul(int a, int b);`
        * `op_div`: returns the result of the division of `a` by `b`. Prototype: `int op_div(int a, int b);`
        * `op_mod`: returns the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`. Prototype: `int op_mod(int a, int b);`
    * **3-get_op_func.c** - This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. You’re not allowed to declare any other function.
        * Prototype: `int (*get_op_func(char *s))(int, int);`
        * where `s` is the operator passed as argument to the program
        * This function returns a pointer to the function that corresponds to the operator given as a parameter. Example: `get_op_func("+")` should return a pointer to the function `op_add`
        * You are not allowed to use `switch` statements
        * You are not allowed to use `for` or `do ... while` loops
        * You are not allowed to use `goto`
        * You are not allowed to use `else`
        * You are not allowed to use more than one `if` statement in your code
        * You are not allowed to use more than one `while` loop in your code
        * If `s` does not match any of the 5 expected operators `(+, -, *, /, %)`, return `NULL`
        * You are only allowed to declare these two variables in this function:

```
op_t ops[] = {
        {"+", op_add},
        {"-", op_sub},
        {"*", op_mul},
        {"/", op_div},
        {"%", op_mod},
        {NULL, NULL}
    };
    int i;
```

<br>

4. **100-main_opcodes.c** - a program that prints the <a href="https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/5eSu8Ohx0ddeNGmaeDo_zQ">opcodes</a> of its own main function.
    * Usage: `./main number_of_bytes`
    * Output format:
        * the opcodes should be printed in hexadecimal, lowercase
        * each opcode is two char long
        * listing ends with a new line
    * You are allowed to use `printf` and `atoi`
    * You have to use `atoi` to convert the argument to an `int`
    * If the number of argument is not the correct one, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `1`
    * If the number of bytes is negative, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status `2`
